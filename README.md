# ProjectEuler
!!! This repository contains the solution to some Project Euler problems. Access this at your own risk.

Project Euler is a website (projecteuler.net) with coding problems. It gives practice to beginners to think like programmers and develop small algorithms
to solve math problems that would be way too long to solve by hand.

I have coded my solutions in Python.
